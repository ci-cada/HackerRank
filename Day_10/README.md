# Day 10

## Objective
Today, we're working with binary numbers. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task
Given a base-10 integer, n, convert it to binary (base-2). Then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in 0's binary representation. When working with different bases, it is common to show the base as a subscript.

### Example
n = 125
The binary representation of  125 is 1111101. In base 10, there are 5 and 1 consecutive ones in two groups. Print the maximum, 5.

## Input Format

A single integer, n.

### Constraints

- 1 <= n <= 10^6 

## Output Format

Print a single base-10 integer that denotes the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the binary representation of n.
