# Day 16 


## Objective
Today, we're getting started with Exceptions by learning how to parse an integer from a string and print a custom error message. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task
Read a string, , and print its integer value; if  cannot be converted to an integer, print Bad String.

Note: You must use the String-to-Integer and exception handling constructs built into your submission language. If you attempt to use loops/conditional statements, you will get a  score.

## Input Format

A single string, S.

### Constraints
- 1 <= |S| <= 6, where |S| is the length of the string S
- S is composed of either lowercase letters (a - z) or decimal digits (0 - 9).

## Output Format

Print the parsed integer value of S, or Bad String if S cannot be converted to an integer.
