# 30 Day Hacker Rank Challenges

This repository contains all my Hacker Rank challenges from day 0 - 30, The days are not consistent cause of a busy schedule and ALX SE program but they are updated every time I have a chance to do them.

There are questions and solutions to the tasks in the Days for anyone who might have a different approach to the projects.

The languages are not specified but I chose to work with Python, for better experience in the language
