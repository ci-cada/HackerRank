## Objective
Today we will learn about running time, also known as time complexity. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

## Task
A prime is a natural number greater than  that has no positive divisors other than  and itself. Given a number, , determine and print whether it is  or .

Note: If possible, try to come up with a  primality algorithm, or see what sort of optimizations you come up with for an  algorithm. Be sure to check out the Editorial after submitting your code.

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, , the number of test cases.
Each of the  subsequent lines contains an integer, , to be tested for primality.

**Constraints**
- 1 <= T <= 30
- 1<= n <= 2 x 10 ^9

**Output Format**

For each test case, print whether  is  or  on a new line.

**Sample Input**
```sh
3
12
5
7

```
Sample Output
```sh
Not prime
Prime
Prime
```
