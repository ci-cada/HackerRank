# Day 14 

## Objective
Today we're discussing scope. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

The absolute difference between two integers, a and , b is written as |a - b|. The maximum absolute difference between two integers in a set of positive integers, elements, is the largest absolute difference between any two integers in _elements.

The Difference class is started for you in the editor. It has a private integer array (elements) for storing  N non-negative integers, and a public integer (maximumDIfference) for storing the maximum absolute difference.

## Task

Complete the Difference class by writing the following:

- A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the  _elements instance variable.
- A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any 2 numbers in  and stores it in _elements the  instance variable.

## Input Format

You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin. The locked Solution class in the editor reads in  lines of input. The first line contains , the size of the elements array. The second line has  space-separated integers that describe the  _elements array.

### Constraints

- 1 <= N <= 10
- 1 <= _elements[i] <= 100, where 0 <= i <= N - 1
 
## Output Format

You are not responsible for printing any output; the Solution class will print the value of the  instance variable.
